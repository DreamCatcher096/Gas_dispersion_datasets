This repository contains publicly available datasets related to gas dispersion in atmospheric environment that collected by myself for research purpose. For each dataset there are several links that provide information to the dataset. Access is either via a direct hyperlink to the dataset, by contacting the owner(s) of the data. If you know of other datasets which in the same area of research, you are welcome to contect me.

### Gas Disparsion in Urban Area or Near Buildings
##### Thompson Wind Tunnel data [[Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/096016869390400S)]
  - [Details on Aarhus University](https://envs.au.dk/en/research-areas/air-pollution-emissions-and-effects/the-monitoring-program/air-pollution-models/background-info/thompsonwindtunneldata)
  - The experimental database of Thompson includes measurements of ground-level centreline concentration distributions for several different combinations of building shapes, stack heights, and stack location relative to the building.

##### The Copenhagen Tracer Experiments [[Reference](https://www.harmo.org/jsirwin/CopenhagenDataReport.pdf)]
  - This series of ten tracer experiments were carried out in the  Copenhagen area in 1978/79 under neutral and unstable atmospheric conditions. The SF6 tracer was released without buoyancy from a tower at a height of 115 meters and then collected 2-3 meters above ground-level at positions in up to three crosswind arcs of tracer sampling units, positioned 2-6 km from the point of release. Three consecutive 20 min averaged tracer concentrations were measured, allowing for a total sampling time of 1 hour. The site was mainly residential having a roughness length of 0.6 m. The meteorological measurements performed during the experiments included standard measurements along the tower of tracer release as well as the three-dimensional wind velocity fluctuations at the height of release.


### Classic Tracer Datasets
##### ROUND HILL I and ROUND HILL II [[Paper](https://www.harmo.org/jsirwin/RoundHillDataReport.pdf)]
  - [Details on harmo](https://www.harmo.org/jsirwin/RoundHillDiscussion.html)
  - Ten minute samples of sulfur dioxide along three arcs (50, 100, and 200 m) downwind of a point source release.  The release height for the 29 experiments in 1954/55 was 30 cm and for the 10 experiments in 1957 was 50 cm.  Receptor height was 2 m.  Site roughness was greater than 10 cm.  10-minute samples were taken on three arcs (50, 100, and 200 m).  A unique feature of the 1957 experiments was that sampling was conducted for the first 0.5 min and 3-min of the 10-minute sampling periods.

##### PROJECT PRAIRIE GRASS [[Reference](https://www.harmo.org/jsirwin/PGrassVolumeI.pdf)]
  - [Details on harmo](https://www.harmo.org/jsirwin/PrairieGrassDiscussion.html)
  - [Excel on Aarhus University](https://envs.au.dk/en/research-areas/air-pollution-emissions-and-effects/the-monitoring-program/air-pollution-models/background-info/omlprairie)
  - Project Prairie Grass included 68 10-minute samples at 1.5 m along five arcs, 50 to 800 m, downwind from a point source release of sulfur dioxide 46 cm above ground.  The 20-minute releases were conducted during July and August of 1956, with an equal number of cases occurring during the daytime and nighttime.  The sampling was for the 10-minute period in the middle of the 20-minute release.  Site roughness was 0.6 to 0.9 cm.
