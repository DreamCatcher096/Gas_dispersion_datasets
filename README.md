This repository contains publicly available datasets related to gas dispersion in atmospheric environment that collected by myself for research purpose. For each dataset there is a link to the original paper, the details summaries of the dataset can be found in "details" link. Access is either via a direct hyperlink to the dataset, by contacting the owner(s) of the data. If you know of other datasets which in the same area of research, you are welcome to contect me. Please note that this repository does not take responsibility for the quality of the data referenced here.

### Classic Tracer Datasets

##### Thompson Wind Tunnel data [[Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/096016869390400S)] [[Details](https://envs.au.dk/en/research-areas/air-pollution-emissions-and-effects/the-monitoring-program/air-pollution-models/background-info/thompsonwindtunneldata)]
  - The experimental database of Thompson includes measurements of ground-level centreline concentration distributions for several different combinations of building shapes, stack heights, and stack location relative to the building.

##### ROUND HILL I and ROUND HILL II [[Paper](https://www.harmo.org/jsirwin/RoundHillDataReport.pdf)] [[Details](https://www.harmo.org/jsirwin/RoundHillDiscussion.html)]
  - The experimental site was near the Round Hill Field Station of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, tracer is Sulfur Dioxide, SO2.
  - Round Hill I: Vertical release through copper tubing 30cm above ground level.
    Round Hill II: Horizontal release through plastic pipe (2 inches in diameter) 1.5 m above ground.
